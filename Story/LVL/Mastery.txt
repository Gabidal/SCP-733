Mastery of anything slows down as the progressions is achieved.
Achieving 1-e from 1-f by method A, might not be valid method to achieve next mastery level increase.

Mastery levels:
 Note: Before looking at the mastery levels please understand that they are RELATIVE, and not absolute, in other words for an example the lowest level here might not stop anybody from performing worse, same applies to the highest ranks, in other words there is no ceiling.  
 All mastering levels are categorized from 1-9 where the letter indicates the inner progress.

 < < < < < < < < *
 0 S A B C D E F ^
 1 S A B C D E F ^
 2 S A B C D E F ^
 3 S A B C D E F ^
 4 S A B C D E F ^
 5 S A B C D E F ^
 6 S A B C D E F ^
 7 S A B C D E F ^
 8 S A B C D E F ^
 9 S A B C D E F ^

In other words 0-S is the best of the best, whereas 9-F is the lowest level that is still considered an an mastery skill.

Where Mastery Level: 0 means perfect mastery of anything, where from 0-B downwards (0-C, 0-D,..) are closer to Mastery Level: 1.
Whereas Mastery Level 0-C and upwards (0-A, 0-S) are an attempt to surpass the Mastery of Mastery. These levels usually are not feasible by mortal entities whose lifespan is too short to achieve it.
Demigods who have dedicated their eons long life to a certain craft can have a possibility of attaining 0-A, whereas 0-S is usually achieved by only GODS, with infinite time in their hands.
There is however an class that not even GODS can achieve this is usually made up to fearmonger young GODS to behave.
Only two entities have achieved this class of Mastery as of this moment, their names are: Grace and Agony.
It is also speculated that Grace and Agony created a third entity of their caliber like a child.
This child of Grace and Agony is said to attain the same class level of Mastery than its parents. 

The Mastery level in question is the Negative scale:
 
  < < < < < < < < *
 -9 T U V W X Y Z ^
 -8 T U V W X Y Z ^
 -7 T U V W X Y Z ^
 -6 T U V W X Y Z ^
 -5 T U V W X Y Z ^
 -4 T U V W X Y Z ^ 
 -3 T U V W X Y Z ^
 -2 T U V W X Y Z ^
 -1 T U V W X Y Z ^

Where -1-T is the lowest level of mastery, and -9-Z is the highest level of mastery.
Why is there even a Mastery level tree at this level?
ONE of the GODS attained the lowest level of the Negative Scale on his own, this put this one GOD level entity at the lowest of the Negative Scale: -1-U
Another GOD also has attained the Negative Scale Mastery but with consuming other GODS, this put him at: -1-X

Within the council of the GODS there is a rumor of the audacity of the reality, where the proposition states:
" What if all that even we GODS can perceive is just a thin sheet from a higher dimensional construct? "

The conjecture proposes that there are higher dimensions of Mastery, whatever that means.
For an example if the Normal and Negative Masteries are only the 2D of the N'th Dimensional Mastery scale and we are at the bottom of it.  
Again this is probably just fearmongering to keep the mischief GODS in check.

But there is nothing to worry about everything is fine.
