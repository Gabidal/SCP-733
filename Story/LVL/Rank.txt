Rank is the power and controllability of an certain situation.

At the lowest rank are the entropic mass, this ranges from water to stones and everything in between.
Above the lowest rank is any system that maintains its entropy or even tries to fight it back, these usually consist of single cellular automata, like cells or a singular nanobot.  
Next up are where the complexity from simplicity starts to form all the way to any type organism that hasn't yet achieved intelligence.

Anything can achieve Intelligence if it:
 - Can parse the critical data given to it, that is related to its survival.
 - Can conclude new data from other data, that may help it survive or thrive.
 - Can pass its learnings to the next generation if it is a organism that dies when aged enough.

The ranks that have been told until now consist of everything of the "Normal" domain.
Above the so called Normal rank are the Supernatural, these can consist of non sentient phenomena like a cursed object.
Supernatural also house the Vampires, Ghosts, Ghouls, Gigantic animals, like gigantic spiders, wolfs, speaking trees.
Some Normals can attain the Supernatural aspect after being exposed to certain criteria or making an contract, where the higher Rank specimen lends power to the lower Rank.

Above the supernaturals are the Half-bloods, where the higher Rank being makes a offspring with a lower Rank being. The Rank of the new offspring can vary depending of the compatibility of its parents.
But usually the offspring has the average Rank of its parents.
Half-bloods usually come to this world starting from the lower Ranking parents Rank, and then have the potential to achieve Mastery level of its higher Ranking parent.
Note: the term Half-blood isn't just locked to the beings that are offspring of higher ranking entities than the supernatural Rank.
 Any Rank that has the capability to combine its traits with some other Ranking entity can bear an half-blood to this world.

Above the Half-bloods are the Demigods. Demigods are entities that usually have an immortal aspect to them, be it an super regeneration that can survive even if it is its last cell. 
Demigods are usually created by more higher ranking entities to do their bidding.
Lower ranking entities can also create their own demigods, although they usually regard them as gods, seeing how much more powerful a demigod is compared to them.

At the same level as the Demigods are the False-gods. False-gods can range from Demigods that want to surpass their higher Ranking creator, or just fame and notion in the world.
False-gods can also just be cursed or non-cursed regular day items that can be regarded as "Holy".
But what differs an False-god Demigod from an "normal" Demigod is their capacity to make contracts with its own followers and thus making itself stronger to some extend.
