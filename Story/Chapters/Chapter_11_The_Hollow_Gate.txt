I, the book writer and in pursuit of facts of this world have stumbled on something i'm not sure i want to write about.
On the outskirts of civilization there was this small and peaceful village near the great eastern river, deep in the forested area. 
It was near end of the winter holiday season i decided to go take a tour over there, according to the locals the people there were mostly old people and some kids.
Most of the young men had to move out, when the factories had to close some time ago. So i took my travel trough small sea men crew who offered me a cheap passage through the river downstream to the old village.
One of the sea men asked me about why i was going there, he had this mix of concerned and curiosity on his face, but i'm not sure since he was mostly looking around the thick grove that surrounded the shores of this prolonged river.
I said i was a writer who writes about interesting knowledge of this world, a little hobby of mine nothing serious. The man replied with a heavy tone asking what is so special about the place?
I didn't read much into it at that time, but now after the fact i can clearly see that he was in fear, going back to his birthplace. I never figured out what really was it, but to this day i see it in my dream, going back to that place like it hymns me into a sweet slumber, making me walk in my dream back to that place, even if it mean to walk by the river bed all the way to that old place.
I brushed his question with the usual "blame the curiosity". Not long after our decent to one of the smaller branches of the river, i could not keep track where we were really, as we passed by more and more tha vegetation around the river seem to repeat, over and over again.
While the captain of the small crew was walking past me to get something in the rear of the boat he noticed my slight confusion on the matter of repeating grove around us and he said:
"As long as you follow the current you'll get out eventually; storms can be a real headache". Then after he said it he said the last part two more times under his breath.
I was getting dark and so i decided to go below the deck where there was an a thin soft blanket over the chest where they stored fishing equipment and took a nap until dawn.
After a sleep that felt like an eternity waiting the men came to get me from below the deck: "Sleeping princess! wake up, we are there."
After i woke up, and climbed those really slippery wooden stairs, through the small dock that the village had, i went back to the river side and washed my face with the water and got spook by the water touching my face.
I already had forgotten that it was winter that was cold and not only the sea weather.
After coming to my senses fully and woken up by the sheer cold splash of water, i finally turned back tot he port, and started walking towards the mid point where the shore and the mossy stone brick path made a cross.
When i tried to make my gaze towards the walk path, to look at the village i saw it. The village! it was there,
I walked towards the first house, all of the houses were supported by few meters of pillars above ground, i think it was to prevent from floods. it was there.
So i approached the first house, it was in this intersection of two branching roads one to the left and one to the right, to the right there was three houses. it was there
The point of where the three houses were there was this small area of opening like a roundabout, the first house on the opposite side and two of the houses leading right where there was then more houses. it was there
This roundabout was covered by snow and ice. There was an upper platform, like it was build as an secondary walkway above the stone path below, again supported by these planks and pillars, few meters above the ground. it was there
There was this frozen onsen, with really warm water, but the strange thing was that it was really small, and the whole thing was made by ice and snow, i'm not sure how it did not melt, since it clearly was hot for the water vapor.
Also it smelled really nice, i tried my hand on it and it felt really hot and citric, somehow. I'm not sure how my arm tasted an flavour but that is what i felt.
I chose not to dive deeper into the frozen onsen mystery. it was there. To the left and and above of the frozen onsen there was the first house you could see when you turned right from the harbour.
I decided to climb the wooden planks, and as i was and old man came out and greeted my and asked: "What is a young soul like yours doing in the depths of the diver?"
As i struggled to get a grip from the slippery planks that had frost built on them, from the vapors of the frozen onsen below, i answered, to write a book.
i finally managed to pull my upper body into the floor boards, as my leg slipped my hart fell also, as i regained my footing and managed to climb the rest. While resting on the upper floor deck of the planks and catching my breath, 
since last time i felt like this was in the junior high, where i almost drowned in the indoor swimming pool.
While the man was speaking i also noticed how, even if the houses here were few meters above the ground, the stone slabs behind the houses in this alleyway of houses surrounded with these huge slabs of machined stones, went much higher than the rooftops of the houses even.
I now was more interested about these inanimate stone works than the people i came here for. So i interrupted the old man rudely and asked, what are these stone slabs for?
The old man was kind enough to realize that i was in total confusion on the matter. I somehow feel i'm not the only one who has behaved like this.
The old man, said: "it is from the old stone crushing facility i used to work at." 
If you were like me below the houses you would probably let the idea slip your mind since most of the slabs and their overhands were covered by these thick roots. The roots were queer, like they were brought up from the ground, they were chunky with dirt on then.
The roots did not seem like something that would grow overtime, no this was like it was risen from the embers from the deep below.
After the first house in the front of the intersection, that i had managed to climb in its floor boards, which were elevated for few meters above ground, i realized that there were these slopes, make out of the same stone slabs.
These ramps were at the lower part manageable to maybe walk on, although with the current weather and my luck i did not want to push it, but the higher you would go with the ramp the steeped the slope began to be.
It was like from the mathematical equations i once saw my teacher draw on the board, it was these exponential curves. This ramp of stones looked like that, but it was hard to fully discern, since i could only see the raps from the front and not from the sides, since the sides were as high as the stone slabs behind the houses.
On the top of the stone walls there were these overhangs and tiny holes, like what you can have ventilation holes for a basement. But this was above ground higher than the rooftops of the houses even.
The stone slabs had to be thick, i first tried to push one, trying to see if it would budge, it did not. Then i put a cloth and then ear to my cloth since i did not want my ear piece to freeze.
But as i was about to put this little piece of cloth from my shirt, i touched it with my bare hands, it it was warm. like a tea left for some time, it had warmth, much more than the surrounding freezing air, but if i were to compare to an temperature of a office room, i would say it would be as warm.
So i tucked my shirt back and this time put my ear into the wall and knocked on the wall, and as the weird not being already weird, i did not hear any signs of hollow, it was solid rock trough and through.
The tiny opening below the overhangs were too high for me to peep from, although i could clearly see that there was no steam or hot air coming from them, i tried to listen but the squeaks of the old wooden floor while the old people were walking made it impossible to hear.
So if i had to hear, hoping that none of the elderly wont be making any noise in their sleep i had to come back later that night.
if it was not for the winter season i would have gone through into the stone slopes, although there is one thing that i did not want to notice this whole time, i knew it was there but it just made no sense.
I tried to not look at them, hoping i would first get some more reasonable answers that would justify such bizarre presence.
At the end of each ramp, there was these giant opening like for a castle door, with a round overhand, again almost willed solid with the same muddy roots. If i could dare myself to climb the certainly frozen stone slopes i could squeeze myself through those.
So i finally asked the old man who was still talking about the earlier, rudely stopping him in mid-sentence.
"What are these ramps for? How do you put stone in there if you cant even make it up there?"
The old man answered: "The ramps were there for the children of the village not to accidentally trying to climb into the stone valves-"
"We push the un-processed rocks into the stone holes, from above the openings, it was the only way not getting any more children wondering down there and getting themselves crushed like poor little jonathan."
The air became stale, like a bitter dream becoming a reality again, drowning the good freezing day into torment. The old man after some time being quiet went back to his home, i did not have time to ask if i could have stayed over for the night.
"He blames himself for what happened that day"- says an old lady behind me. It was the third house, second from the right turn from the roundabout, on the opposite side of the stone road. 
I did not need to climb down and then back up again, since the houses were connected with this shady woodwork with the squeaky pillars holding my weight. 
I tried carefully sneak closer and closer to the old lady peaking to my. The old lady said "You walk even slower than my mother did right before she died!" in a laughing manner.
I explained how i was not keen of high places, and the old lady tried to assure me that the woodwork will do it's job as it was intended. 
After i got myself painfully slowly to the other side of the woodwork, the old lady grunted "took you long enough". I could see that she had way more speed than most of the people i see in her age group. Like she knew her life would come to an halt any if she stopped even for a moment.
She told me about the story of how the old man was once the village chief and he was also the manager of the stone company, here.
She filled me with the sad story of what went down that fateful day, when the son of the village chief was missing for few days for then to then find her crushed corpse few weeks later.
I'm not sure what part of the story she told me was real and delusions of old people, since she started to speak of how she once had this feeling that after the incident one fo the stone slabs was like watching her, and how the eye of the son was embedded into it, with this deaths gaze, yearning for death, to stop the agony.
But i was lying if i would say that i did not have similar feeling of something piercing my skin every time i i would turn around in this place, like turning around would be the last thing i should ever do.
Since that trip i have had few times the exact nightmare, where i would find myself in the same village again, but there are no one anywhere, and just the howling of the sound.
Everywhere is the lush noise of the leaves like whispering something sweet, and the fresh like an cold grape that you would buy from the market freshly picked from the vineyard.
Everywhere there is this lush life and sound but the stone. The stone is quiet. The stone does not whisper. The stone does not concur with your thoughts, it's like when you rise up too quickly and everything becomes black for a moment.
When i look at the stone i don't feel anything or hear anything, it is just like that black cloud that envelopes your senses.
It is like a invitation to come and rest, from all the noise, from all the anxiety. So i slowly climb the slope, covered in a thin layer of snow which feels like styrofoam, a slippery layer but when you brush it off, it easily reveals the black stone underneath.
So i won't raise my legs, instead i fray my shoes against the stone wall, like a snow shovel, picking up the snow before me, one movement of the leg at a time.
Then i get to the point where the slope is too steep for me to stand on it, so i use my hands to push myself away from both sides of the wall, giving me some grip.
Then i was at the doorway of the gaping hole, which was mostly filled with the same dried muddy roots. 
After i manage to squeeze myself past the small opening, i'm faced with a stoned wall yet again, there is nowhere to go other than right, after few meters i turn right again, still going up.
After few painfully slow moments of climbing the stone floors up, which was way more steeper inside than outside. At least there was no snow inside the tunnel.
Then i went left, and after few meters i went left again, but i had to stop there. Until now i had to go up, giving me a chance to go out easily, but after the second left turn, 
the slope was no longer going up, but steeply down, i could risk it. After all the place was yearning for me to come and take a loop. The deeper i went to more the air started to smell like something and not the nothingness.
But then it struck me, i rushed out, i ran i had to. just sliding down the slope outside was not fast enough, i had to run the heart was pounding i was like in fight or flight response.
I flew i did not think. Just for a moment so short i finally realized, the emptiness that i felt from the stone. The silence, the lack of smell it never was nothing, it was because at that time i felt like nothing.
Because it reminded me of the place i was when i was as a child, the morgue. The smell that i could not point out clearly what it was, was rot and flesh.
When i came close to the doorway, the brush of the dried muddy roots, felt like hanging intensives, dried up and molded, which made them chunky.
I did not look back, i ran like a tog tail between its front paws.
After waking up to such nightmares again after again, i decided to visit the same place again. I had to confirm, if the roots were roots.
So i bought the tickets to the same place again, hopped in the train, and went to the fishing village i was last time.
After arriving late in the evening, i found the same crew, albeit with few new faces.
I asked them if they could give me ride back to that banal place.
At this time of the year it was the late sprig, and most of the ice and snow had smelted away.
The trip felt longer than last time, maybe it was the anxiety scorning myself, but i hold myself together, it felt like i had to scream, laugh and cry at the same time.
Like a enveloped by the same flight or fight response that i had in my dreams, but it lasted all the way until we came ashore. I climbed gripping the blister wooden stairs in the port where the boat was anchored.
So i managed to pull myself and climb aboard the wooden platform that swayed with the tides that the river and the boat made while the crew of the ship that i arrived with moved about.
After walking slowly the port to keep it from swaying more than it already did. After regaining my balance on solid ground i finally started moving faster, like all that feeling i was harbouring was starting to spill into my legs, making me walk and run cycling in between.
After i walked along the shore to the left of the harbour i came to the cross section, where those stones slabs made their first appearance, like a opera of red curtains slowly revealing what is behind them.
Then i stood still and turned right, and there it was. it was there.
I came to the intersection of the two paths again, this time on the right side there was in the roundabout area just stone floor, there wasn't anything that deep nor was the snow that high last time i came, that the frozen onsen would be at.
The first house in the opposite side of the intersection was still these with it's squeaky sounding woodwork as the wind hindered it side to side, like it was hymning to this song of wind.
The two houses to the right of the interdiction were still there, albeit i did not see the old lady there anymore, maybe she decided to sleep in.
The house the old lady lived in, was straight on the other side of the road, where on the opposite side the giant slope was. The opposite side of the old mans house i never got to see who lived there.
I Clearly could see the rest of the houses down the road on the right side of the intersection after the old ladies house, but my purpose this time was one and one thing.
I did not climb the woodwork this time and after witnessing that things were as they were i went back to the boat in the harbour until night came.
After nightfall, i made my way with a lantern on my right hand, illuminating my way in the moonless sky.
With my footsteps masked by the cicadas and other wildlife i made my way in the nights eye, back to the start of the slope.
Without the snow covering the stone, it surely was to be easy to climb, albeit this is real and not a dream.
I touched with my left hand to see if the stones were wet or dry, and not to my surprise it was dry as this paper before i drown it with the black ink.
The warmth of the stone was still there, like it stood there welcoming me back home from a long trip.
I put the lantern down and pulled myself above the ledge into the slope, picked up my lantern and tried to slowly advance, each time putting my lantern little further and then making myself past it.
After the climb started to be too steep, i hanged the hot lantern by my belt, determined to push through the hot burning metal against my skin through the thin clothes i had on.
The real slope felt a lot longer and harder than the one in my dreams, albeit rather familiar, like i knew all the groves like i had seen those groves from close before.
After feeling like my skin was about to be peeled off the harsh texture of the slabs, i made my way to the giant doorway. at the ledge i took some time to let my hurting hands to recover from the pain.
While waiting i looked up to the overhead filled with thick and chunky roots, and they were indeed just roots covered in hard sediment.
As i was resting with my lantern on my side laying on the floor slab next to the slab on the wall the illuminated light at the specific angle gave something away that i did not notice before.
The slab next to the lantern had writings on its bottom left corner, the lantern's light gave the groves and helped me to decipher them out. My assumption is that these were the numbers of each stone slab made.
"Who would number a stone?" I mumbled under by breath. I took out my small note and started to write down with my small portable pen i had brought just for these kind of situations.
As i started to scribe down what i read from each stone close to the floor, since i would not make out what what on the roof tiles, since the roof tiles and most of the wall tiles were to high up, with the doorway being at least fifteen or more meters in height.
numbers are as follows:
3.37, 103.37, 173.113, 31.113 for floor tiles, two slabs make the diameter of the floor. I did not go deeper into the doorway for numbers, since i wanted to scribe as much i could i decided to move slowly.
The numbers after the dot seemed to be for the same row, since the slabs on the walls had the same ending numbers on left side: 131.37, 101.37, 113.113, 1733.113
and on right side: 1301.37, 7717.37, 1777.113, 7703.113
I still do not understand to this day, why would anyone number these stones and then not putting them in order.
After taking note, i picked up my lantern and switched the fuel.
Picking up where i left of i started to crawl through the root groves.
Even today as i continue writing this nightmare into a peace of paper, readying to be sent to my friend Nichole. I smell the dirt from the roots that my shirt pulled as i was crawling through the doorway.
The smell is like after a heavy rain flooding the streets with dead worms. Sometimes i smell it on fresh small tomatoes, reminiscing me of that night.
As i continued deeper into the doorway, i stumble on something that closed questions but opened questions for me delirium.
The doorway ends up with a wall, there is nothing here, i tried touching it, reaching my hand in this festered tight grove, the wall was way more warm that the floor slabs i was dragging myself through.
Pushing my self through the roots, putting my ear to the wall and knocking silently, fearing i might make my presence known to someone who i don't want to know i am here.
But it was solid, and i did not hear anything, nor did the knock echo throughout the hallway, since the roots covered the most of it.
So i did and knocked louder trying to provoke, with my slight frustration with an empty answers. And still nothing, and so i knocked even louder.
Some sort of panic started started to fester within me. All this time, all of this for what? Am i really losing my shit for some stupid stones? No there had to be something i am missing.
