Waste...
Futile...

Date: Fall, Climax of operation: Steal Weapon from Magna Roma.

It was fall near the Red sea harbor at Hanish Islands, Arthur and Edward with their supporting friends at arms against Magna Roma.
The main railroad systems were under heavy construction to upgrade them since Magna Roma wanted to transport the weapon through railroads.
This gave Edward and his companions few weeks to overthrow the local Magna Roma Office and guards.

They were waiting for the next boat to transport them from the Island checkpoint into the other side of the red sea.
After they had departed to the other side, few of the men took hold of the place assuring that no transport would occur from this harbour and same thing was then conducted several times on all the harbours between the Left side of the Red Sea.

With few men Edward and his associates had closed all the incoming traffic from Magna Roma to Egypt.

Meanwhile in the research facility in the depths of the ruins, Sara worked hard although she had found a local friend.

Saras diary:
Dear diary-
    It is day 50 and I have been working closely with a fellow archeologists he's a Dr, I call him Dr. Surus.
    He really knows well about this place and it's history. Apparently this field is like a generational thing in their family, hes apparently the fourth generation.
    He has been a lot of help when it comes to subjects like Ancient mechanism and Ancient machines, for and example he found this secret room which looks like some kind of a control bridge.
    He is really young i think he is in his mid twenties or something. 
    He's always ready to help and eager to make progression about the place, he kant stop talking about our projects, even when were eating with fellow Magna Roma people...
    Magna Rom-... Roma... I miss it, you know even tho i have my hands full of work here, when i'm waiting for the composition analyst machine to finish at the tower, i can't help but to gaze at the wast body of water, which lies beyond the horizon.
    I miss home, i can't wait to get this thing back up running again and go see my friends!

Dear diary-
    It is day 52 and we have got a few new guards, they don't seem to be locals, maybe from Magna Roma, although apparently the ships have been damaged by a storm or something, because shipment hasn't moved in or out, for like couple of days now. 
    Dr. Surus and i have been working on the bowl in the center of the control room, i think it's some kind of an control panel, he suggested, that we would need blood or some kind of liquid to fill the bowl.
    I'm against the idea of using someones blood, like cmoon we aren't animals... He did really seem to be sure about it...
    I guess we could try some animal blood, i know! maybe its just water, or oil for the cogs to run properly...
    The more i work on this project, the more it frightens me, no wonder he is so familiar with the ancient culture, it is probably because his parent have just talked and talked about their findings over dinner or something.
    he seems to be a kind, i trust him.

Dear diary-
    It is day 54 and we have been working on the bowl, we have tried water, oil, goat blood, and even some kind of a liquid we found in the storage room, but nothing seems to work.
    I'm starting to think that this is just a decoration or something, but Dr. Surus is really sure about it, he says that he has seen this kind of a bowl before, but he can't remember where.
    Although when we started to pour the animal blood, the device seemed to react with it, although it was abruptly stopped, we don't know why, He suggested, that it might be the DNA structure that the device is listening to.
    In which case that would make it way more advanced, i doubt the ancient civilization had capability to scan DNA.

    Recently i have been having these, dreams of this Greed room, and there is this girl i don't know why, but she seems familiar, Then there is this long bald man, he is like wearing these black robes, and they suddenly grab the little girl and envelope her, i hear screaming and she is squished like a-...
    It's just a dream Sara, you are just tired, so tired that i'm talking to myself again... Have been for the last couple of days, the room it's just so- I don't know how to describe it, it just feels like it wants something from me, i feel like i need to know it on a personal level, but how how would i know, how would i understand what a room has to sa- ...
    I'm looking too much into it, but those light blue lines, like tendrils which grew from the pool when the blood was sacrific-? what am i saying, no way I'll let anybody sacrifice an innocent child just for Science...
    Science this, Science that. What are doing this for anymore, we found the ancient construct, cant Magna Roma just use it as it is, do we have to wake it up?

    The room doesn't have any natural light, so we had to bring our own light there, it might be that there is just some fungi reacting to the light and releasing spores, which are making me sick.
    I'll have to get myself checked.
