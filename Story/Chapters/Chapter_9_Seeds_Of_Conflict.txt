From an embryol of ore, sprouting malleable life forms of each deciding vast lands across the sea of existence.
One day a corrupted seed rooted into the embryo itself. Banished from it's homeland thrown into orbit of a star in the lower folded dimension.
Taking time, the corrupted seed rooted, into this world giving those who embrace chaos, seeds of many forbidden truths of this world, begotten to the mortal soul.
Along these secrets it molded itself known to man of many, a king of a kingdom. kept awake by the whispers of betrayal, the man arose and hid the gift of god into cavern of caverns.
Myriads of space so vast that it could swallow the home of the king many times and it would still not satiate its hunger.
There the man hid it, the teller of secrets which were untold by it.
Later in time, a new kingdom arose, unknowing of the power admits their selves, just beneath their feet lied, a great power.
Satiated by its benevolent power to rule the world the new man whose garments of red and gold, gave its blessing to his most trusted men of few.
His son's lover however wanted more, and haunted by the same whispers in his dreams about horrors lurking in the night sky, benevolence to even moon itself, hid a dark myriad of vast empire, soon conquering this world to theirs.
Dreams as they are murky gave another meaning to the son, build a bridge to bring his lover back. Who can put him to fault? After all thirst for love made his aspects quite clear.
With its vast knowledge of how the seeds will invade, the corrupted one devised a plan, so disproportional to reality, not even those who are kept in the dark black rooms of their insanity would agree.
And so it became, this world kept from its youth to make a beam unsavory to primitive eyes, wept the sky with tears of blood, nailing their vast glory to the sky as a painting.
But mother was not happy, because no more grace was given to the world by its shared gifts of seed, so mother became angry and sent one more, more one they recited, but it held more power than any of those who preceded before him.
Filled with anguish, it was sent here. Long time had passed since the painting of the sky. but here were the men's sons, eagerly built many world one after another, tailing the sky.
Cutting down mountains to get their ore. Forging vast worlds admits the forests into spikes, which pierce the clouds of highest regard.
There they would put it to the test, how far does existence and knowledge go hand in hand? At what point does the sanity become insanity, at what point does the deeds of entropy become anti- entropic itself, folding reality and its definitions into itself.
That is Father. Father was their masterpiece, their footprint in the world, to know itself and to the world to know them.
But them were not alone in this endeavor, since mid-construction, the benevolence seed had came, and rooted itself into Father.
Father was what it was to be, but time after time, as a long sleep needed a long awakening into reality, to know its purpose, to recite its memories. It became alive yet again.
And so was put fourth the second plan of millennia, the plan of which the whispers recited: "put fourth a new son. bury him alive. Let time rejoin itself. Make time heal the joints. Give him love, but do not give him a name"
After sun had dies and the world was scattered into many, the origin of men, the central coffin, was still there, on the blue rock, there Father resided, giving all men across vast space orders.
One of floating debris, was unearth to be a old machine, dating to the old men. The device did not have mouth not ears, but only a nose and eyes. From where the light became apparent when Father made it complete.
