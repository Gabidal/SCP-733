Date: 1949 14'th of july, United Stated of America, Research lab located in New Mexico.
Time: 04:00 AM

Person A: "Ok, so all the parameters are in the expected range, can proceed to launch."
*Voice in the radiophone*: "3, 2, 1 and Launch!"

Somewhere close by an rocket prototype proceeds to take of.

After a excruciatingly quiet moment, the radio voice continues:
*Lift of was successful!*

The team behind the voice seem to cheer up.
Person B: "What did i say, we did it!"
Person A: "Well not that was the easiest part, next: Sling-shotting through all the different orbiting bodies until we exit the gravitational presence of our star." 
Person A: "Well at any case you can go grab drink with the other i'm gonna stay the night and watch over the orbital."
Person B: "Ok, but don't kill your self now, after all we need you next week to held the press conference you know."
Person A: "I just might be."

Date: 1949 16'th of july
Time: 09:00 AM

Person A: "Alright what did i miss?"
PCI: "Parameters in nomal range Sir."
Person A: "Good, notify me of anything un-expected happens, ok?"
PCI: "Understood."

Date: 1949 20'th of july
Time: 02:30 AM

An alert was raised at the research lab waking the head researcher who was taking a all nigher again.
*Red siren lights lighting the monitor room in dark red light*

Person A: "PCI, report!"
PCI: "Warning: Gamma rays anomal."
Person A: "This should't be happening we haven't even came close to exiting the suns G-Sphere"
Person A: "PCI log on coordinates!"
PCI: "Sir my reading are giving me exactly: 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 Light years, which is the exact same as the maximum numbers i can hold on one constant."
Person A: "Well yeah there is probably a collision with a space dust, and has broken the position system."
Person A: "Switch to photon scan mode and analyze the star patters to determine the current location and give me a recap!"
PCI: "Yes sir! Crunching numbers..."
*After a loud silence*
PCI: "Sir the light radar mapping system might be broken, since the stars are not aligned to the database."
Person A: "Open visual UI"
*After looking at the star map captured by the orbital*
Person A: "..."
Person A: "Send a light pulse straightly towards the orbital and count the ticks until the light has bounced back."
PCI: "Calculating trajectory and reflections... sending light pulse"
Person A: "Notify me when the pulse has bounced back!"
PCI: "Will do Sir."

Date: 1949 21'th of july
Time: 04:00 PM

Person B: "What do you mean by it is no where to be found? You got the the parameters from it not? Then how are you communicating with a unit if it isn't even there?"
Person A: "Do you remember that one guy who was rambling about the entanglement stuff maybe this is that."
Person B: "Oh again putting all the reasoning and blame on quantum physics are we?"
Person B: "The man up, wants a memo on this ASAP, if he can't make an good impression on the conference tomorrow, this project is done for."

Date: 1949 24'th of july, Chicago, basement
Time: 01:00 AM

PCI-Lite: "Sir!"
Person A: "What i was having a great dream, first you take my job and now my sleep hours, huh!"
PCI-Lite: "Sir, the light pulse has returned!"

Person A, stares at the clock for a moment and then realizes what that means, and rushes to the monitor.
Person A: "Crunch the numbers PCI!"
PCI-Lite: "Sir the number is too large for 64-bit handling would you like me to use the new AVX system?"
Person A: "Please do!"
PCI-Lite: "Using the new AVX number handling system the Value is: 237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935"
Person A: "..."
Person A: "Ok, has the vessel moved since the last contact?"
PCI-Lite: "Yes"
Person A: "Initiate 3D scan of the surrounding area."
PCI-Lite: "Will do... Here are the results Sir."
Person A: "Transfer the rendered environment to the analytical unit and crunch some structural analysis."

After some tome...

PCI-Lite: "Calculations complete, would you like the results shown?"
Person A: "Yes."

A low-resolution picture starts rendering into the giant wall from the projector.

Person A: "PCI, what is the probability to get another probe out there?"
PCI-Lite: "0.2%"
Person A: "Good enough. PCI, start rendering the most optimal structure to get the most mass up to there."
PCI-Lite: "Yes, Sir!"

Date: 1950 14'th of july, Chicago, basement
Time: 04:00 AM

PCI-Lite: "Launching in 3, 2, 1, and liftoff!"
PCI-Lite: "Parameters nomal, entering max-Q in 3, 2, 1, and max-Q!"
Person A: "How close are we to the schedule?"
PCI-Lite: "This run is almost 99% identical to the 1949 run."

Date: 1950 20'th of july
Time: 02:28 AM

Person A: "Are there?"
PCI-Lite: "Almost there Sir."

Time: 02:29:50 AM

PCI-Lite: "Entering the jump in 3, 2, 1...."
Person A: "What happened?"
PCI-Lite: "Sir, maybe the last try was the last."
Person A: "No, something this big can't just vanish, the fluctuations would have been noticed, all through the globe. Continue the same trajectory."
PCI-Lite: "Yes Sir!"

Date: 1950 22'th of july
Time: 10:45 AM

Person A opens the door to his apartment and starts to brew coffee and proceeds to open his newspaper when the alarms goes off.
Person A: "PCI! What is it?"
PCI-Lite: "Sir, we have made it! Although the location seems to be different from the first launch."
Person A: "What do you mean different?"
PCI-Lite: "The location is 1.2 light years from the original location."
PCI-Lite: "There is also this really radioactive point nearby do you want me to analyze it?"
Person A: "Please do."
PCI-Lite: "Analyzing..."
PCI-Lite: "Sir, i think you should take a look at this."

When Person A takes a look at the rendered picture his mug drops of his hand.
PCI-Lite: "Sir, is everything alright?"
Person A: "That's a fucking thing, like a living living thing!"
Person A: "How is it possible to hold it's structure with it's size. PCI analyze."
PCI-Lite: "The structure in question seems to be..."

The PC Interface goes dark, and then words can be heard from the speakers that the PCI Uses.
At first the voice speaks in an inaudible language, but slowly little by little person A starts to understand.

Voice: "You are somewhere where don't belong to, little one. You don't seem to belong to the nearby star constructs, where you are from i sense a great amount of pain and Agony."
