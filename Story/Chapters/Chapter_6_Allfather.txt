Date: 1949 14'th of july, United Stated of America, Research lab located in New Mexico.
Time: 04:00 AM

Person A: "Ok, so all the parameters are in the expected range, can proceed to launch."
*Voice in the radiophone*: "3, 2, 1 and Launch!"

Somewhere close by an rocket prototype proceeds to take of.

After a excruciatingly quiet moment, the radio voice continues:
*Lift of was successful!*

The team behind the voice seem to cheer up.
Person B: "What did i say, we did it!"
Person A: "Well not that was the easiest part, next: Sling-shotting through all the different orbiting bodies until we exit the gravitational presence of our star." 
Person A: "Well at any case you can go grab drink with the other i'm gonna stay the night and watch over the orbital."
Person B: "Ok, but don't kill your self now, after all we need you next week to held the press conference you know."
Person A: "I just might be."

Time: 09:00 AM

Person A: "Alright what did i miss?"
PCI: "Parameters in nomal range Sir."
Person A: "Good, notify me of anything un-expected happens, ok?"
PCI: "Understood."

Time: 02:30 AM

An alert was raised at the research lab waking the head researcher who was taking a all nigher again.
*Red siren lights lighting the monitor room in dark red light*

Person A: "PCI, report!"
PCI: "Warning: Gamma rays anomal."
Person A: "This should't be happening we haven't even came close to exiting the suns G-Sphere"
Person A: "PCI log on coordinates!"
PCI: "Sir my reading are giving me exactly: 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 Light years, which is the exact same as the maximum numbers i can hold on one constant."
Person A: "Well yeah there is probably a collision with a space dust, and has broken the position system."
Person A: "Switch to photon scan mode and analyze the star patters to determine the current location and give me a recap!"
PCI: "Yes sir! Crunching numbers..."
*After a loud silence*
PCI: "Sir the light radar mapping system might be broken, since the stars are not aligned to the database."
Person A: "Open visual UI"
*After looking at the star map captured by the orbital*
Person A: "..."
Person A: "Send a light pulse straightly towards the orbital and count the ticks until the light has bounced back."
PCI: "Calculating trajectory and reflections... sending light pulse"
Person A: "Notify me when the pulse has bounced back!"
PCI: "Will do Sir."

Date: 1949 21'th of july
Time: 04:00 PM

Person B: "What do you mean by it is no where to be found? You got the the parameters from it not? Then how are you communicating with a unit if it isn't even there?"
Person A: "Do you remember that one guy who was rambling about the entanglement stuff maybe this is that."
Person B: "Oh again putting all the reasoning and blame on quantum physics are we?"
Person B: "The man up, wants a memo on this ASAP, if he can't make an good impression on the conference tomorrow, this project is done for."

Date: 1949 24'th of july, Chicago, basement
Time: 01:00 AM

PCI-Lite: "Sir!"
Person A: "What i was having a great dream, first you take my job and now my sleep hours, huh!"
PCI-Lite: "Sir, the light pulse has returned!"

Person A, stares at the clock for a moment and then realizes what that means, and rushes to the monitor.
Person A: "Crunch the numbers PCI!"
PCI-Lite: "Sir the number is too large for 64-bit handling would you like me to use the new AVX system?"
Person A: "Please do!"
PCI-Lite: "Using the new AVX number handling system the Value is: 237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,935"
Person A: "..."
Person A: "Ok, has the vessel moved since the last contact?"
PCI-Lite: "Yes"
Person A: "Initiate 3D scan of the surrounding area."
PCI-Lite: "Will do... Here are the results Sir."
Person A: "Transfer the rendered environment to the analytical unit and crunch some structural analysis."
