Description:
    With long black hair and dark blue eyes, Star comes from a farming family located east from the capital of Sea Empire.
    Her best friends are Thomas, Cynthia and Luke. Her favorite food is potato smash with carrots and rabbit.
    Star admires history of Empire of Ocean, especially the mysterious disappearance of the whole opposing kingdom of the desert dwellers.
    She is a very friendly person, and is always willing to help others, a very good cook, and is always willing to share her food with others, a very good fighter, and is always willing to fight for the weak.
    Although this good willing of her heart makes her vulnerable to the scheming lot.  
    She lost her most dearest friends on the battle field when the undead king attacked her home land. She also lost her family who couldn't escape the hunt-dogs.
    After losing all that is dear to her, she started to think why was what she was, and why all of it had to happen on her lifetime and someones elses.
    Sometime after loosing everything she met a young boy with a long black scarf, he kept Star some company and even taught her to hone her sword skills even further by meeting someone.
