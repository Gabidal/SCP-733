Storm Star grew strong and beautiful with long black hair. Wielding a giant sword that she carried on her back.
One peaceful night after training with his dad and helping her mother with the homework, she fell into slumber.
She woke up in the middle of the night, and saw some thing scary in the corner of the room staring back at her.

"So small, yet so important."
"Potential to yield, power to shape mountains."
"That i will harvest from you, in turn i will put something in your heart."

Suddenly Storm Stars heart started to ache, she wanted to cry and shout from the pain, but she couldn't even move a muscle.

"Pawn of mine you shalt become."
"The contracts the forefathers made, and i will persuade the old world to do so."
"I'm just a messenger, contractor between the old world and the new one."
"Become mine and i shall teach you the way of the old world."

She suddenly wakes up and spring out of bed, and screams, while grabbing her long sword and trying to point at the thing.
Her father rushes to the room, and asks what is going on.
Shy tries to explain but in the panic she faints.
Her father caches before she hits the ground, and her father takes a glare at that one corner with a look of a killer. All the birds nearby fleed the place.
The next morning Storm Star wakes up, and asks what happened.
her father said: "I was coming from work, and i heard your scream and so i dropped my wheelbarrow and rushed here, to see you faint."
Storm star says: "T-th-there was a thing at the corner it told something i don't quite remember, m-my memory is somewhat hazy. Oh and then i felt like my heart would explode."
"When i woke up i noticed that i was dreaming and then you came and i don't know what happened next."
Her father said: "You fainted from screaming, there was no thing in the corner when i checked"
"Maybe your were just tired and the physique was tearing you down. It could also be that today is the Grand Colosseum tournament starts today, and it is your first time being a participant init."
She quickly stood up from her bed in a rush trying to put all her things up for the tournament while eating her breakfast that her father had brought up.

When she arrived to the front yard of the colosseum, her friend were waiting for her, these were friends she grew up with and goes to the School with.
Although she only trains her sword skills with her had, since teachers of the sword skills are really expensive.

Storm Star: "Are you guys ready?"

Thomas: "Born ready"
Cynthia: "Lets go already"
Luke: ~Mutters something~

Thomas is a childhood friend of Star, he is specialized in the art of the Book incantations, where you use a casting book as your weapon.
Cynthia is also a dear friend of Star, her weapon of choice is a Fencing sword of type Sabre. She also uses magic to enhance her physical abilities
like speed, strength, agility, defense
Luke is a newcomer from the lands beyond the sea, he doesn't really like socializing. He has mastered a hand to hand combat style inherited from his bloodline.

They go to the giant gate where there is a man sitting behind a desk, and register to the Tournament as fighters.
Star gets a glimpse of a person with a black hood on his head, and totally black outfit. She gets the same feeling from him, like the Thing.

Thomas asks: "Everything alright?"
Star says: "Yeah, i just poorly slept."
Thomas says: "Well lets hope you wont space out like this in a middle of a fight."

They proceed to the colosseum, where they each are assigned to a specific bench where to put their belongings.

The first round is a preliminary round where the last 10 proceed.
After the preliminary round all of them proceed.

It is Stars first 1v1 other than the 1v1s with her dad.
Her opponent is a chain mace wielding giant. He shouts: "Little ladies don't belong to the battle ground, go wash clothes, hahahaa!"
She just smiles, and to that the enemy gets angry and starts to run towards Star and fails his chain mace, Star evades all of the attacks.
The mace wielding shouts: "You have a great sword but you cant even swing it with your little frail arms, and proceeds to make his final swing with the chain mace.
Star notices this move, and prepares the make a counter swing with get great sword, but she doesn't move her hand until the last moment, in a clean and fast swing she not only deflects the chain mace, but destroys the chain mace, and land a critical hit on the enemy.
The crowd is silent before cheering for the victory.

Thomas loses his fight.
Cynthia loses too.
Luke wins his.

After some other matches the remaining contestants are: Luke, Star, and one other.
Luke tries to fight the other contestant, but fails.

it is the grand final and it is Star against the one that defeated Luke.
At the start of the mach Star asks what is the name of the enemy, and he says: "Gray, Gray of house Shell"

When the fighting ring plays both of them unsheathe their weapons. 
Star feel that something is strange, his opponent didn't give anything that would remark him someone who knew to wield a great sword like herself. 
But still even with the clumsy looking stances and steps he still countered all of her attacks.

Star started to get furious that someone who didn't even know how to use a great sword could best her.
Gray asked: "Whats the matter?"
Star said: "You move like you cant even lift your feet, and your feet move more clumsy than the old dog of my neighbors. Yet you manage to evade and even strike back with the same force as i"
Grey: "Even if you know how to wield a great sword doesn't mean that it is the only way of wielding it."
"But fine if this irritates you so much, here"
Suddenly Gray drops his weapon and the crowd stars to question what is he doing.
Suddenly Star doesn't see Gray and there is a voice behind her, "Where are you looking at?"
She manages to evade an explosion, turns out that Gray can also wield wordless casting.

Gray says: "Is this better?" "The great sword wasn't for my liking anyway, my palms started to sweat"
Star asks: "So you could just grab a weapon and instantly master it?"
Gray says: "Don't know what this mastering you are prefer to, i just swang big metal sheet up and down." 


They both gather all their might for the final blow.
The impact causes a big cloud of dust from the explosions.

When the smog started to dissipate, the two of them were still standing, until Gray fell and the crowd cheered."
Before Star passed away also, she say the same black hooded man in the crown, he walked away as if he was disappointed with something."
