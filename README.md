# SCP-733

If you want to figure the real story read the Story folder, but do not read this folder if you want the pure SCP experience.
The story content is for those who want to expand the series.

Have fun!

### Why on github?

As to why this is on github, well later on i will try to use the Deterministic Markovchain to analyze and test if i can make a system that does not need NN, to continue or make a summary of any asked topic from the Story or the SCP-733. 

### Other participants

You can make new scp-entries from the story, and make pull requests.
